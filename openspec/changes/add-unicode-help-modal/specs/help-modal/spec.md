# Help Modal Capability

**Capability**: `help-modal`
**Depends On**: None
**Related To**: `search`

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Provide accessible help modal for Unicode education

The application MUST provide an educational help modal that explains Unicode concepts, emoji encoding, and table interpretation to users unfamiliar with technical terminology.

#### Scenario: Opening help modal from search area

**Given** the emoji table application is loaded
**When** the user clicks the help trigger in the search controls area
**Then** a modal dialog opens with Unicode education content
**And** the modal is properly announced to screen readers
**And** focus is moved to the modal content
**And** the page background is dimmed with an overlay
**And** body scrolling is disabled while modal is open

#### Scenario: Help modal contains educational sections

**Given** the help modal is open
**When** the user reviews the modal content
**Then** the modal contains a section explaining Unicode basics
**And** the modal contains a section explaining code point notation (U+XXXX)
**And** the modal contains a section explaining UTF-8 encoding
**And** the modal contains a section explaining character vs code point counts
**And** the modal contains a section explaining how to read the table columns
**And** the modal contains practical examples using emoji data
**And** all content uses clear, beginner-friendly language

#### Scenario: Closing help modal via multiple methods

**Given** the help modal is open
**When** the user clicks the X close button
**Then** the modal closes and focus returns to the help trigger
**When** the user presses the ESC key
**Then** the modal closes and focus returns to the help trigger
**When** the user clicks on the modal backdrop/overlay
**Then** the modal closes and focus returns to the help trigger

#### Scenario: Help modal keyboard accessibility

**Given** the help modal is open
**When** the user navigates using the Tab key
**Then** focus is trapped within the modal
**And** focus moves between the close button and any interactive content
**And** focus does not escape to page content behind the modal
**When** the user presses Shift+Tab from the first focusable element
**Then** focus moves to the last focusable element in the modal

#### Scenario: Help modal responsive design

**Given** the help modal is triggered on different screen sizes
**When** the modal opens on a desktop screen (>1024px)
**Then** the modal appears centered with appropriate maximum width
**And** the modal content is easily readable with proper spacing
**When** the modal opens on a tablet screen (768px-1024px)
**Then** the modal adapts to smaller width while maintaining readability
**When** the modal opens on a mobile screen (<768px)
**Then** the modal fills most of the screen with appropriate margins
**And** content scrolls vertically if needed

### Requirement: Help trigger integration with search controls

The application MUST provide a clearly labeled help trigger in the search controls area that opens the Unicode education modal.

#### Scenario: Help trigger placement and styling

**Given** the search controls are displayed
**When** the user views the search area
**Then** a help trigger (button or link) is visible near the search input
**And** the help trigger has clear visual indication of its purpose (icon or text)
**And** the help trigger has appropriate hover and focus states
**And** the help trigger is positioned to not interfere with search functionality

#### Scenario: Help trigger accessibility

**Given** the help trigger is present in the search controls
**When** a screen reader user navigates to the help trigger
**Then** the trigger is announced with descriptive text (e.g., "Help: Learn about Unicode and emoji encoding")
**And** the trigger has proper ARIA attributes
**When** a keyboard user navigates to the help trigger
**Then** the trigger is focusable and activatable with Enter or Space keys

### Requirement: Modal content accuracy and examples

The help modal MUST contain technically accurate information about Unicode and emoji encoding with practical examples from the current dataset.

#### Scenario: Unicode basics explanation

**Given** the help modal content section on Unicode basics
**When** the user reads the Unicode basics section
**Then** the content explains what Unicode is and its purpose
**And** the content explains how Unicode assigns numbers to characters
**And** the content is written in accessible, non-technical language
**And** the content includes why Unicode matters for emoji

#### Scenario: Code point notation explanation

**Given** the help modal content section on code points
**When** the user reads the code points section
**Then** the content explains the U+XXXX notation format
**And** the content provides examples using actual emojis from the table
**And** the content shows how code points relate to the "Code Point" column

**Example content**:
- "😀 has the code point U+1F600"
- "The 'Code Point' column shows this Unicode identifier"

#### Scenario: UTF-8 encoding explanation

**Given** the help modal content section on UTF-8 encoding
**When** the user reads the UTF-8 section
**Then** the content explains how Unicode code points become byte sequences
**And** the content shows why the "UTF-8" column contains escape sequences
**And** the content explains the relationship between code points and byte size
**And** the content uses examples from the emoji table

**Example content**:
- "😀 (U+1F600) becomes the UTF-8 sequence \\xF0\\x9F\\x98\\x80"
- "This emoji requires 4 bytes to store in UTF-8 encoding"

#### Scenario: Character complexity explanation

**Given** the help modal content section on character complexity
**When** the user reads the character complexity section
**Then** the content explains why some emojis have count = 1 and others have higher counts
**And** the content provides examples of simple emojis (count = 1)
**And** the content provides examples of skin tone variants (count = 2)
**And** the content provides examples of ZWJ sequences (count = 3+)
**And** the content explains why more code points mean more complex emojis

**Example content**:
- "Simple emoji: 😀 uses 1 code point"
- "Skin tone variant: 👋🏻 uses 2 code points (hand + skin tone modifier)"
- "Family emoji: 👨‍👩‍👧 uses 5 code points (man + ZWJ + woman + ZWJ + girl)"

#### Scenario: Table interpretation guide

**Given** the help modal content section on reading the table
**When** the user reads the table guide section
**Then** the content explains what each column represents
**And** the content provides guidance on interpreting the values
**And** the content connects the explanations to the previously covered concepts

### Requirement: Modal performance and integration

The help modal MUST not negatively impact application performance or interfere with existing functionality.

#### Scenario: Modal doesn't affect page load performance

**Given** the emoji table application loads
**When** the initial page load completes
**Then** the modal content does not delay the page load
**And** the modal is ready for use without additional loading time
**And** the presence of modal code doesn't slow table rendering

#### Scenario: Modal doesn't interfere with table functionality

**Given** the help modal is open
**When** the modal is displayed over the emoji table
**Then** the table content is not modified or affected
**And** search functionality remains intact (hidden behind modal)
**And** pagination state is preserved
**When** the modal is closed
**Then** all table functionality works exactly as before
**And** any previous search or sort state is maintained

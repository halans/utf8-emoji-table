# Add Unicode Help Modal

**Change ID**: `add-unicode-help-modal`

## Problem Statement

Users viewing the emoji table are presented with technical Unicode terminology and data that may be unfamiliar:
- Unicode code points (U+1F600 format)
- UTF-8 byte sequences (\xF0\x9F\x98\x80)
- Code point counts (1, 2, 5, etc.)
- Byte sizes (4, 8, 12, etc.)
- The relationship between characters and their encoding

Without understanding these concepts, users cannot fully appreciate the technical information displayed or understand why certain emojis have different complexity levels. This creates a barrier to learning and reduces the educational value of the application.

## Proposed Solution

Add an interactive help modal accessible from the search area that provides clear, educational explanations of Unicode and emoji encoding concepts. The modal will:

- Explain Unicode fundamentals and code point systems
- Demonstrate UTF-8 encoding with practical examples
- Clarify the difference between characters and code points
- Show why some emojis require multiple code points (skin tones, ZWJ sequences)
- Illustrate how byte size relates to encoding complexity
- Provide interactive examples using actual emojis from the table

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Learning**: Users gain understanding of Unicode and encoding concepts
- **Improved User Experience**: Reduces confusion about technical terminology
- **Educational Value**: Transforms the tool into a learning resource
- **Accessibility**: Makes technical information approachable for all skill levels
- **Context-Aware Help**: Information is directly relevant to the displayed data

## Scope

### In Scope
- Help modal with educational content about Unicode and UTF-8
- Help trigger button/link in the search controls area
- Modal accessibility features (keyboard navigation, focus management, ARIA attributes)
- Responsive modal design for mobile and desktop
- Interactive examples using emoji data from the table
- Multiple close mechanisms (X button, ESC key, outside click)
- Clear visual hierarchy and readable typography

### Out of Scope
- Advanced Unicode topics (normalization, collation, etc.)
- Programming tutorials or code examples
- Links to external Unicode resources
- Printable or downloadable help content
- Multi-language help content
- Video or animated explanations
- Context-sensitive help for specific table rows

## Technical Approach

1. **Modal Infrastructure**: Create reusable modal component with proper focus management
2. **Content Structure**: Organize help content into logical sections with examples
3. **Trigger Integration**: Add help button to search controls area with clear labeling
4. **Accessibility**: Implement WCAG 2.1 AA compliant modal with screen reader support
5. **Responsive Design**: Ensure modal works across all device sizes
6. **Performance**: Lazy-load modal content to avoid affecting initial page load

## Content Strategy

The help modal will be organized into clear sections:

1. **Unicode Basics**: What Unicode is and why it matters
2. **Code Points**: How U+XXXX notation works with examples
3. **UTF-8 Encoding**: Why emojis become byte sequences
4. **Character Complexity**: Simple vs multi-code point emojis
5. **Reading the Table**: How to interpret each column
6. **Practical Examples**: Real emoji breakdowns from the current dataset

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**: This is an additive feature that enhances existing functionality without breaking changes.

- No modifications to core table functionality
- Modal overlay pattern is well-established
- Content is static and unlikely to cause technical issues
- Can be disabled or hidden if needed

## Dependencies

- Creates a new `help-modal` capability
- No external dependencies required
- Compatible with existing search and table functionality
- Integrates with current accessibility patterns

## Success Criteria

1. Help modal opens when help trigger is activated
2. Modal content clearly explains Unicode and encoding concepts
3. Examples in modal relate directly to emoji table data
4. Modal is fully accessible via keyboard and screen readers
5. Modal closes via multiple mechanisms (X, ESC, outside click)
6. Modal design is responsive across all device sizes
7. Help trigger is discoverable and clearly labeled
8. Modal doesn't interfere with existing table functionality

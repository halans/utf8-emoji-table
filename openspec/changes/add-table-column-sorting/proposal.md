# Add Table Column Sorting

**Change ID**: `add-table-column-sorting`

## Problem Statement

Users currently cannot sort the emoji table by different columns, making it difficult to:
- Find emojis with specific characteristics (e.g., highest byte count, alphabetical order)
- Analyze emoji data patterns (e.g., grouping by code point count)
- Navigate large datasets efficiently beyond basic search and pagination

The current table display shows emojis in their original file order, which may not match user needs for different analysis or browsing patterns.

## Proposed Solution

Add interactive column sorting functionality to the emoji table that allows users to:
- Click column headers to sort data in ascending/descending order
- Sort by multiple data types: numeric (Count, Bytes), alphanumeric (Code Point, UTF-8), and alphabetical (Name)
- Combine sorting with existing search and pagination features
- See clear visual indicators for current sort state

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Data Discovery**: Users can quickly find emojis by their technical properties
- **Improved Usability**: Intuitive sorting patterns familiar from other data tables
- **Better Analysis**: Researchers and developers can analyze emoji complexity patterns
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader support for sort state and controls

## Scope

### In Scope
- Clickable column headers for sortable columns
- Ascending/descending sort for: Code Point, Count, UTF-8, Bytes, Name
- Visual indicators (arrows) showing current sort column and direction
- Integration with existing search filtering
- Preservation of sort state during search operations
- Accessibility labels and ARIA attributes
- Performance optimization for large datasets

### Out of Scope
- Multi-column secondary sorting (e.g., sort by Count, then by Name)
- Custom sort orders or user-defined sorting rules
- Sorting the Character column (emojis don't have meaningful sort order)
- Save/restore sort preferences across sessions
- Export sorted data functionality

## Technical Approach

1. **State Management**: Extend application state to track current sort column and direction
2. **UI Enhancement**: Make column headers interactive with click handlers and visual indicators
3. **Sorting Logic**: Implement type-aware sorting functions for different data types
4. **Integration**: Ensure sorting works seamlessly with search filtering and pagination
5. **Performance**: Use efficient sorting algorithms suitable for the dataset size

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**: This is an additive feature that enhances existing functionality without breaking changes.

- No API changes required
- Backward compatible UI changes
- Well-established UX patterns
- Can be implemented incrementally

## Dependencies

- Modifies the existing `table-display` capability
- No new external dependencies required
- Compatible with current pagination and search features

## Success Criteria

1. Users can click any sortable column header to sort the table
2. Visual indicators clearly show the current sort column and direction
3. Sorting persists when using search functionality
4. Performance remains acceptable for the full emoji dataset
5. Screen readers announce sort state changes appropriately
6. All existing functionality (search, pagination, copy-to-clipboard) continues to work

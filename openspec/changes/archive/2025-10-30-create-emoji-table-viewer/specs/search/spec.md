# Search Capability

**Capability**: `search`
**Depends On**: `data-fetching`
**Related To**: `table-display`, `pagination`

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Provide search input interface

The application MUST display a search input field that allows users to filter emoji data.

#### Scenario: Search input renders on page load

**Given** the application loads with emoji data
**When** the page renders
**Then** a search input field is visible
**And** the input is labeled "Search emojis or names"
**And** the input has a placeholder text indicating search functionality
**And** the input is positioned above or near the table

#### Scenario: Search input is always accessible

**Given** the application is rendered
**When** the user interacts with other controls (pagination, page size)
**Then** the search input remains visible and accessible
**And** the search input retains any entered search query

---

### Requirement: Filter emojis by character

The application MUST filter the emoji dataset to show only emojis matching the entered character.

#### Scenario: Search for emoji by typing the character

**Given** the table displays all emojis
**When** the user types "ðŸ˜€" in the search input
**Then** the table updates to show only emojis containing "ðŸ˜€"
**And** the results appear immediately (within 200ms)
**And** pagination resets to page 1 of filtered results

#### Scenario: Partial emoji character search

**Given** the user searches for a multi-codepoint emoji sequence
**When** the user types part of the sequence
**Then** emojis containing that sequence are shown
**And** the search handles emoji components correctly

---

### Requirement: Filter emojis by name

The application MUST filter the emoji dataset to show only emojis whose official Unicode name matches the search query.

#### Scenario: Search by full name match

**Given** the table displays all emojis
**When** the user types "grinning face" in the search input
**Then** the table shows all emojis with "grinning face" in their name
**And** the search is case-insensitive

**Example matches**:
- "grinning face"
- "GRINNING FACE WITH SMILING EYES"
- "grinning cat face"

#### Scenario: Search by partial name match

**Given** the table displays all emojis
**When** the user types "heart" in the search input
**Then** the table shows all emojis with "heart" anywhere in their name
**And** matches include: "red heart", "heart with arrow", "couple with heart", etc.

#### Scenario: Case-insensitive name search

**Given** the user searches for emoji names
**When** the user types "FACE" or "face" or "FaCe"
**Then** all matching emojis are returned regardless of case
**And** the official name casing is preserved in display

---

### Requirement: Display search results in real-time

The search MUST update results as the user types without requiring form submission.

#### Scenario: Real-time filtering as user types

**Given** the user starts typing in the search input
**When** the user types each character
**Then** the table updates after each keystroke
**And** the update happens within 200ms of the keystroke
**And** no "search" button press is required

#### Scenario: Clear search clears filter

**Given** the user has entered a search query with filtered results
**When** the user clears the search input (deletes all text)
**Then** the table immediately shows all emojis again
**And** pagination is recalculated for the full dataset
**And** the user returns to page 1

---

### Requirement: Combine character and name search

The search MUST match emojis where EITHER the character OR the name matches the query.

#### Scenario: Search matches character OR name

**Given** the user searches for "red"
**When** the search executes
**Then** results include emojis with "red" in the name (e.g., "red heart")
**And** results also include the "ðŸ”´" character if typed
**And** the search is an OR operation (either match qualifies)

---

### Requirement: Handle no search results

The application MUST provide clear feedback when no emojis match the search query.

#### Scenario: Display empty state for no matches

**Given** the user enters a search query
**When** no emojis match the query
**Then** the table displays an empty state message
**And** the message indicates "No emojis found matching '[query]'"
**And** pagination controls are hidden or show "0 results"

#### Scenario: Search counter displays result count

**Given** the user enters a search query
**When** results are filtered
**Then** the result count is displayed (e.g., "Found 42 emojis")
**And** the count updates as the query changes

---

### Requirement: Search performance optimization

The search MUST remain responsive even with large datasets.

#### Scenario: Search completes quickly on full dataset

**Given** the emoji dataset contains ~3000-5000 emojis
**When** the user performs any search
**Then** results appear within 200ms
**And** the UI does not freeze or lag

#### Scenario: Search input debouncing (optional enhancement)

**Given** the user types rapidly in the search input
**When** multiple characters are entered quickly
**Then** the search MAY debounce to avoid excessive filtering
**And** debounce delay SHOULD NOT exceed 300ms
**And** final results appear within 200ms of last keystroke

---

### Requirement: Search persistence and state

The search state MUST be maintained during user interactions.

#### Scenario: Search persists when changing pages

**Given** the user has searched for "heart" with results spanning 3 pages
**When** the user navigates to page 2 of the results
**Then** the search query remains in the input
**And** only matching emojis are shown on page 2
**And** clearing search while on page 2 returns user to page 1 of all emojis

#### Scenario: Search persists when changing page size

**Given** the user has a search filter applied
**When** the user changes the page size
**Then** the search query remains active
**And** the filtered results are repaginated with new page size
**And** the user returns to page 1 of filtered results

---

### Requirement: Keyboard accessibility for search

The search input MUST be fully accessible via keyboard.

#### Scenario: Keyboard focus on search input

**Given** the application is loaded
**When** the user presses Tab to navigate
**Then** the search input receives focus
**And** a visible focus indicator is shown
**And** the user can immediately type to search

#### Scenario: Clear search with keyboard

**Given** the user has entered a search query
**When** the user presses Escape key while focused on search input
**Then** the search input is cleared
**And** the filter is removed showing all emojis
**And** focus remains on the search input

---

### Requirement: Screen reader support for search

The search functionality MUST be accessible to screen reader users.

#### Scenario: Screen reader announces search results

**Given** a screen reader user enters a search query
**When** the search results update
**Then** the screen reader announces the number of results
**And** the announcement format is "[X] emojis found"
**And** the user can navigate to the updated table

# Data Fetching Capability

**Capability**: `data-fetching`
**Related To**: Foundation for `table-display`, `search`, `pagination`

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Fetch Unicode emoji files from unicode.org

The application MUST fetch emoji data from three official Unicode consortium text files on application initialization.

**Source URLs**:
- `https://www.unicode.org/Public/emoji/latest/emoji-test.txt`
- `https://www.unicode.org/Public/emoji/latest/emoji-sequences.txt`
- `https://www.unicode.org/Public/emoji/latest/emoji-zwj-sequences.txt`

#### Scenario: Successful file fetching on initialization

**Given** the application loads in a browser with internet connectivity
**When** the page initializes
**Then** all three Unicode emoji files are fetched in parallel
**And** the application waits for all fetches to complete before rendering
**And** a loading indicator is displayed during the fetch operation

#### Scenario: Handling network errors during fetch

**Given** the application attempts to fetch Unicode files
**When** one or more fetch requests fail due to network error
**Then** the application displays an error message to the user
**And** the error message includes which file(s) failed to load
**And** a retry button is provided

#### Scenario: Handling CORS restrictions

**Given** the Unicode files are blocked by CORS policy
**When** direct fetch fails with CORS error
**Then** the application displays a helpful error message
**And** suggests alternative solutions (proxy, local files, etc.)

---

### Requirement: Parse emoji data from Unicode text files

The application MUST parse the fetched text files and extract emoji data into a normalized structure.

**Data extraction**:
- Unicode code point(s)
- Character (rendered emoji)
- UTF-8 byte representation
- Official Unicode name
- Source file identifier

#### Scenario: Parsing emoji-test.txt format

**Given** the emoji-test.txt file is fetched successfully
**When** the parser processes the file content
**Then** each valid emoji line is parsed into the data structure
**And** lines starting with `#` (comments) are ignored
**And** empty lines are skipped
**And** code points are converted to the actual emoji character
**And** UTF-8 representation is generated from code points
**And** the official name is extracted

**Example line**:
```
1F600 ; fully-qualified # ðŸ˜€ E1.0 grinning face
```

**Expected output**:
```javascript
{
  codePoint: "U+1F600",
  character: "ðŸ˜€",
  utf8: "\\xF0\\x9F\\x98\\x80",
  name: "grinning face",
  source: "emoji-test.txt"
}
```

#### Scenario: Parsing emoji-sequences.txt format

**Given** the emoji-sequences.txt file is fetched successfully
**When** the parser processes multi-codepoint sequences
**Then** code points separated by spaces are combined into single characters
**And** the sequence name is extracted correctly
**And** the source is marked as "emoji-sequences.txt"

**Example line**:
```
1F441 FE0F 200D 1F5E8 FE0F ; RGI_Emoji_Sequence ; eye in speech bubble
```

#### Scenario: Parsing emoji-zwj-sequences.txt format

**Given** the emoji-zwj-sequences.txt file is fetched successfully
**When** the parser processes ZWJ (Zero Width Joiner) sequences
**Then** ZWJ sequences are correctly combined into single emojis
**And** the combined character renders properly
**And** the source is marked as "emoji-zwj-sequences.txt"

**Example line**:
```
1F468 200D 1F373 ; RGI_Emoji_ZWJ_Sequence ; man cook
```

#### Scenario: Handling malformed data lines

**Given** a Unicode file contains malformed or unexpected lines
**When** the parser encounters lines it cannot parse
**Then** those lines are logged to console as warnings
**And** the parser continues processing remaining lines
**And** the application does not crash

---

### Requirement: Store parsed emoji data in memory

The application MUST maintain all parsed emoji data in a client-side data structure accessible to other capabilities.

#### Scenario: Data storage after successful parsing

**Given** all three Unicode files have been parsed
**When** parsing completes
**Then** all emoji entries are stored in a single array
**And** duplicate emojis (same code point) are deduplicated
**And** the array is accessible to table, search, and pagination components
**And** the total count of emojis is calculated

#### Scenario: Data availability check

**Given** parsed emoji data is stored in memory
**When** any component queries the data
**Then** the data is immediately available without additional fetching
**And** the data structure includes all required fields for each emoji
